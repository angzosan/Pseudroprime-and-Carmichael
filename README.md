# Pseudroprime-and-Carmichael
Scripts that detect : 1. If a number is a carmichael number 2. if a number is pseudoprime or not.
Carmichael Numbers: 
A Carmichael number will pass a Fermat primality test to every base  b relatively prime to the number, even though it is not actually prime.

Pseudoprime numbers:
A pseudoprime is a probable prime (an integer that shares a property common to all prime numbers) that is not actually prime. Pseudoprimes are classified according to which property of primes they satisfy.
